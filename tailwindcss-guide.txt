âœ… Option 1: Rename the config file to .cjs (recommended)
Rename your file:
postcss.config.js â†’ postcss.config.cjs
Then update its content like this (CommonJS syntax):

module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}

This works because .cjs is automatically treated as CommonJS even if you're in an ES Module project.

âœ… Option 2: Convert to pure ESM (if you donâ€™t want to rename)
Change the file to use ESM export like this (but not recommended for PostCSS, due to inconsistent support):

export default {
  plugins: {
    '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}

But this breaks in some Vite plugins due to the way PostCSS is loaded. So again:

ðŸ”¥ Best practice: Just rename to postcss.config.cjs.

âœ… Final Checklist
postcss.config.cjs uses module.exports = {...}

tailwind.config.js stays as is (it supports ESM)

"type": "module" can stay in package.json

Youâ€™ve installed:
npm install -D tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss autoprefixer
